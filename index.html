			<h2>His Countless Exploits
			</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					He was the official opposition leader in the federal parliament to the Balewa government from 1959â€“1963
				</li>
				<li>
					Obafemi Awolowo was the first premier of the Western Region and later federal commissioner for finance, and
					vice chairman of the Federal Executive Council during the Nigerian Civil War.
				</li>
				<li>
					Awolowo was responsible for much of the progressive social legislation that has made Nigeria a modern nation.
					In 1963, he was tried and jailed for 10 years on charges of sedition. He was pardoned by the government until
					1966, after which he appointed the Minister of Finance. In recognition of all of this, Awolowo was the first
					individual in the modern era to be named as the leader of the Yorubas
				</li>
				<li>
					In 1945, he attended the fifth Pan-African Congress in Manchester as a representative of the Nigerian Youth
					Movement along with H. O. Davies. Also attending was an illustrious list of participants which included Kwame
					Nkrumah, Hastings Banda, Jomo Kenyatta and Jaja Wachuku, among others.
				</li>
				<li>
					he advocated federalism as the only basis for equitable national integration and, as head of the Action Group,
					he led demands for a federal constitution, which was introduced in the 1954 Lyttleton Constitution, following
					primarily the model proposed by the Western Region delegation led by him
				</li>
				<li>
					From the eve of independence, he led the Action Group as the Leader of the Opposition in the federal
					parliament, leaving Samuel Ladoke Akintola as the Western Region Premier.Disagreements between Awolowo and
					Akintola on how to run the Western region led the latter to an alliance with the Tafawa Balewa-led NPC federal
					government. A constitutional crisis led to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Western Region,
					eventually resulting in a widespread breakdown of law and order.
				</li>
